				<p>Even though inbound marketing is not a relatively new concept, it is certainly being executed in a number of new ways. People often associate content marketing with blog posts and social outreach. However, restricting content to those parameters can lead to many overlooked opportunities. You want to make sure that your business doesn’t miss out on a chance to generate creative and engaging content throughout alternative sections of your website.</p>

As one of the most visited locations on any given company’s site, the "About Us" page plays a large role in the first impression that you leave on a potential customer. This is where they come to learn more about your company and the people behind the brand. A customer looks here before they start to take your business (or the idea of collaborating with it) seriously.</p>
